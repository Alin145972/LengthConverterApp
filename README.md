# LengthConverterApp
JAVA miniproject n.2 (height conversion app)

This is a simple program that takes feet and inches values and converts them in centimeters values. When you enter  numeric values and click on the "Convert" button, it outputs the corresponding value in centimeters. If one or both of the numbers are negative it asks you to enter positive values only. If you enter only the feet value or only the inches value it will default the other value to zero before converting. Also if you dont enter anything and click convert it will default both at zero before converting. If you enter a non-numeric value it asks you to enter valid values. There is also a reset button;

You can test the app by running the LenghtConvTestApp.jar file. Or by opening it in Eclipse and running LenghtConverterApp/src/lenghtConverter/Frame1.java.

If LenghtConvTestApp.jar doesn't run try installing jdk-17
